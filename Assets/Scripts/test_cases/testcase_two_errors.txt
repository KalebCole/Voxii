08:00:15 User: Hi, I want to order some coffee, please.
08:00:30 Assistant: Sure! What kind of coffee would you like?
08:01:10 User: I don’t know what to get. Can you recommend me something?
08:01:30 Assistant: Of course! Do you prefer something strong, sweet, or something in between?
08:02:00 User: I like strong coffee, but not too bitter. What you have that like that?
08:02:30 Assistant: I recommend trying an Americano or a flat white. They’re both strong but not too bitter.
08:03:10 User: Okay, I take an Americano. Can you make it with almond milk?
08:03:40 Assistant: Absolutely! Would you like anything else with that?
08:04:00 User: No, that’s all for now. How much it is?
08:04:30 Assistant: That will be $4.50. You can pay at the counter when you're ready.
08:05:00 User: Thanks! I will do that now.
